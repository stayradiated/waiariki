<h2>Streaming Music Services</h2>

<p>Formats of music</p>

<ul>
<li>Vinyl recordings</li>
<li>Compact Disks (CDs)</li>
<li>Digital format (MP3s etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the idea that you pay for a song and then you can listen to it.
Of course laws in place to stop you from making a copy of it and sharing it
with other people.</p>

<p>Purchasing an album from a physical store, or even online, the idea is you find
some music you like and then you pay for it.</p>

<p>Piracy is quite different</p>

<ul>
<li>Napster</li>
<li>Limewire</li>
<li>Torrents</li>
</ul>

<p>The same idea, you still have to know what music you want before you can find
it. (Not to mention that in most cases downloding music for free is typically
illegal). [Link to another wiki].</p>

<p>Then you have radio stations.
A place where you can tune in and listen to songs picked by someone else that
will usually be pretty good.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>What is streaming?</strong></p>

<p>Streaming music is basically listening to music online, without actually having
a copy of the song.</p>

<p>Many streaming music services are free to use, and don't even require an
account. Instead they make their money through advertisements and premium
subscriptions model that give users extra features.</p>

<p>Streaming music has been around for a while, but only recently has it started
to become mainstream.</p>

<p>Apple released their iTunes match, which allowed users to swap their mp3
collection for high quality streamed songs. http://www.apple.com/nz/itunes/itunes-match/</p>

<p>In September 2013 Apple also released iTunes Radio, where you can listen to new
songs based on your music library, so it can pick songs that match your music tastes.
Currently only avaliable for those in the United States.</p>

<h2>Survey Results</h2>

<h3>Purchasing physical media</h3>

<p><em>When was the last time you bought a physical piece of music (like a CD)?</em></p>

<p>Majority of people surveyed (46.15%) haven't purchased a CD in the last two
years.</p>

<p>However 23% of those surveyed have purchased a CD in the last month.</p>

<p>Quite a variety of people.</p>

<p>Those who have moved away from diss, but still a lot of people who regulary buy
CDs. Obviously their are benefits to both, those who like owning the physical
disc, and those who favour the convenience of having their music in the cloud.</p>

<h3>Paying for music online</h3>

<p><em>How often do you pay to download music?</em></p>

<p>Nearly 70% of those surveyed they very rarely pay for music downloads, from never
at all to at most once a year.</p>

<p>We could assume that these people don't aren't interested in music, or could be
illgally pirating music, or may listen to artists who publish their music for
free.</p>

<p>// Not sure about this question</p>

<h2>Ways to listen to music</h2>

<p><em>Where do you most often listen to music?</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Streaming (58%)</li>
<li>Purchased downloads (25%)</li>
<li>Purchased pysical media (0%)</li>
<li>Radio (17%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Someone also said they mostly listen to their personal mp3 collection.
Probably would have been the most popular with iPods before everything became
connected to the cloud.</p>

<h2>Popular Music Services</h2>

<p><em>Which streaming music service do you use the most?</em></p>

<p>According to the survey, the most popular streaming music services (in order) are:</p>

<ul>
<li>YouTube (50%)</li>
<li>Pandora</li>
<li>Spotify</li>
<li>GrooveShark</li>
<li>iTunes</li>
<li>Deezer</li>
<li>SOMA FM</li>
<li>8Tracks</li>
</ul>

<h2>How many people use streaming music services</h2>

<p><em>How many streaming music services do you use?</em></p>

<p>Everyone who answered the survey said they used at least one streaming music
service, and the majority (43%) regulary used two of them.</p>

<p>From this we can see that streaming music services is a very popular way of
listening to music, and that most people use more than one service.</p>

<p>For example, if we take the two most popular music services, YouTube and
Pandora, we can assume that the majority use YouTube to find one of songs, as
YouTube has a wide range, and use Pandora radio to just listen as background
music, and not have to worry about finding the next song.</p>

<h2>Will people pay for streaming music services</h2>

<p><em>Do you pay for any streaming music services?</em></p>

<p>About two thirds of the people surveyed don't pay for streaming music services.</p>

<p>A lot of services are free to listen to, but they also tend to have
advertisements and have paid subscriptions to remove them.</p>

<h2>How much do people pay?</h2>

<p><em>If so, how much do you pay currently per month?</em></p>

<p>Interestingly, the majority of people pay less than $1 per month for their
streaming music subscription. This shows how cheap services are.</p>

<p>No one paid between $1 - 4, with the 22% of people paying between $5 - 9.</p>

<p>So we can say that on average for a year, most people pay between $0 - $108 on streaming music services</p>

<h2>How much would people pay?</h2>

<p><em>What is the most you would pay per month?</em></p>

<p>The results are quite evenly distributed.</p>

<p>Though the majority of people, would pay $5-9.</p>

<p>No one would pay more than $20 for streaming music services, which is
reasonable, as that is quite expensive at $240 a year.</p>

<h2>Do people mind advertisements?</h2>

<p><em>How do you feel about advertisements on streaming music services</em></p>

<p>The same amount of people of people are bothered by the ads, as those who
aren't bothered by them.</p>

<p>21% of people don't even notice the ads.</p>

<p>Interested in how a third of people pay for streaming music, but only 7% pay
for a subscription to remove the ads.</p>

<h2>Radio Stations</h2>

<p>Similar to streaming music services where you listen to it online, but instead of specifically choosing a song, you find a station you like and someone else chooses the music (like analogue radio).</p>

<p>Find a station you like and discover new songs.</p>

<p>You can't choose specifically what song to listen to.</p>

<p>Songs are usually based on a user specified genre.</p>

<p>Some services (like Pandora Radio) allow you to vote a song up or down, depending on whether you want to hear more songs like it.</p>

<p>If you vote on every song you listen to, the service will get better on picking songs that you like.</p>
