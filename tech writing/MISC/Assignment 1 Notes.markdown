# Site One: Apple Support for iPhone

- Has lots of information easily available
    - Help articles
    - Hardware manuals
    - Technical specifications for devices
    - Community forums to ask more specialized questions

## 1. Design rules

- Good layout
- List of different categories
- Categories have icons that relate to phone icons
- Each category is split into sections, each with multiple troubleshooting topics
- Topics have different types:
    - Instructions: A page with step by step instructions and images. Simple to follow. Setting locations are in bold, such as "Go to __Settings > General > Software Update__". Also has additional information at the bottom of the page, as well as related topics.
    - Interactive assistants: Similar to instructions, except broken up into
      seperate bite size pieces with a next button to proceed and more
      illustrations. Also allows to jump to a page using the navigation in the
      left pane.
    - Different support areas: A link to a different support area with more
      specialized information about a topic. E.g. In the syncing category is a link to the iTunes support page.

- Manuals are also available online as a PDF document. These are very detailed, but also have useful index pages.

## 2. Relevant material

- Material is very relevant.
- Everything is kept in major categories (iPhone, Macbook, iTunes), and each
  has minor categories (Essentials, Messages, FaceTime, Apps).

## 3. Consistent Paragraph Layout

- Very good
- Everything is laid out in a standard way
- Instructions - _iOS: Setting up an email account_
- Explanation - _iOS: Understanding Notifications_
- Sections > Question > Answer

## 4. Wordiness

- Not too wordy, but still enough information.

## 5. Tone

## 6. Jargon

- Uses simple language terms.
- Jargon is only used in contexts when it is assumed you know what it is.
- For example: Using _"FaceTime", "iPad"_ in an article about using FaceTime.
- Does have some technical terms, but majority of it is geared toward the
  audience.
- Simple topics have no jargon, advanced topics have more jargon.

## 7. Spelling and Grammar

- I couldn't find any errors, in the help topics.
- Using the W3C spell checker

## 8. Correct referencing

## 9. Navigation

- Very simple, easy to find what you are looking for.
- Categories, topic
- Has a search bar.

# Site Two: Acer Support

- Has a horizontal scroll bar to find support for different products. It works ok, but it only shows 3-4 products at a time.

Articles are sorted into categories, but the categories are only available
through the search page. I.e. It's not obvious that you can filter by
categories.

- Article headers look like links, but aren't. You actually need to click the 'Read more >' link.
- Has a keyword search.

- Sometimes has videos to complement text instructions.
- Instructions tend to be very short, less than quarter of a page.
- Ask Acer layout is quite complicated
- Has links to _Answers others found helpful_

- Has a list of _Previously viewed answers_ to jump back to an article you viewed
  in the past.

- Has a list of _Most Popular Answers_ for different sections

- Change topics on _http://acer-au.custhelp.com/app/home/_ by hovering over the
  icons. Not the best way to do it.

- Navigating around the site is hard.

- The green colour scheme makes it hard to separate links from headings.

- Read more icons have the bottom cut off.
