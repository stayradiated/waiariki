## Project Costs

All projects incur costs. Project costing is a key factor in making project
decisions. As a project manager, you need to be aware of the type of costs that.

There are four types of costs in a typical project:

    +--------+----------+-------+----------+
    | Direct | Indirect | Fixed | Variable |
    +--------+----------+-------+----------+

### Direct Costs

These are costs clearly assigned directly to the project.

For example: if you are building a website and have hired/outsourced some of
your website developers, they are expected to put in a specific amount of time,
which is then billed for. The web developer salaries are direct costs.

_Hiring some to do the project for you, is a direct cost._

### Indirect Costs

Indirect costs are those that are shared across multiple projects. Indirect
costs are sometimes also referred to as Oversight costs.

For example: in software development projects, it is common for a project
manager or an architect to be partially allocated across several projects.
Hence, the cost of the project manager or architect will be shared among the
projects they are allocated to.

Project managers are usually an indirect cost to the project. This is because
their work is to supervise. They donâ€™t actually do the work! __The people who do
the work, like developers and designers, are Direct Costs to the project.__

Other examples:

- Taxes
- Training
- Travel costs
- Advertising
- Transport

### Fixed Costs

These do not change throughout the life-cycle of a project

For example: If you are constructing a road, the excavators and bulldozers are
fixed costs. For software development projects, the physical development space
and development computers are fixed costs to the project.

Other examples:

- Rent
- Insurance premiums
- Loan
- Equipment

### Variable Costs

Variable costs, as the name suggests, are costs that change during the project
life-cycle.

For example: In 1987, the Channel (Euro) Tunnel project begun. The objective of
this project was to construct an undersea high-speed train tunnel that would
connect Great Britain to France. The project was completed over a period of 3-4
years and at a cost of about 13 billion U.S. dollars. The project employed over
15,000 people and had cost overruns. This project required tremendous risk
management skills. During the construction of this project there were several
variable costs, such as fuel costs and labour rates.
