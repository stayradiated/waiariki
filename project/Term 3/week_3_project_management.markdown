## Learning Outcomes

- Describe the 4 stages of the project life cycle
- Demonstrate an understanding of projects versus normal operations
- Describe the role of the project manager
- Understand why projects might succeed or fail

## What is a project?

- A project is a unique venture with a beginning and end, conducted by people to meet established goals within parameters of cost, schedule, and quality.
- Projects are goal-oriented, involve the coordinated undertaking of interrelated activities, are of limited duration, and are unique
- There are ‘projects’ and there are real projects!!
- A real project is not a big task, but many small tasks that can span to weeks or months

## A Project

A decision to do something new or something differently

_It has a purpose, a goal_

- To upgrade existing - systems
- To replace or change - existing systems, business structure, marketing plan, costs, revenues
- To implement new - systems, strategies, process
- To research and evaluate options – competitor analysis, business case

## Definition of a Project

- A project is a temporary endeavour undertaken to create a unique product or service. 
- Temporary means that every project has a definite beginning and a definite end. 
- Unique means that the product or service is different in some distinguishing way from all similar products or services.

## Characteristics

__Project vs Normal Work__

### Project

- Take place outside the process world
- Unique and separate from normal organization work
- Continually evolving

### Normal 

- Ongoing, day-to-day activities
- Use existing systems, properties, and capabilities
- Typically repetitive

## Project or Normal Work?

Organisations perform work. Work generally involves either
Normal business operations _OR_ Projects 

Although the two may overlap, normal business operations and projects share many characteristics, for example they are both; 

- Performed by people.
- Constrained by limited resources.
- Planned, executed, and controlled


## Project are Temporary Endeavours

Temporary means that every project has a definite beginning and a definite end. 
	
The end is reached when the project’s objectives have been achieved, or when it becomes clear that the project objectives will not or cannot be met and the project is terminated. 

Temporary does not necessarily mean short in duration; many projects last for several years.
 
In every case, however, the duration of a project is finite; projects are not ongoing efforts.


## Temporary also means

- That the project is not just about the ‘Delivered Product’ but a process 
- That Best Practice suggests it follows a prescribed Project Life Cycle
- That there is a defined Project Team for the life of the project

## Examples - Temporary

The ‘opportunity’ or ‘market window’ is usually temporary — most projects have a limited time frame in which to produce their product or service.

The project team, seldom outlives the project —most projects are performed by a team created for the sole purpose of performing the project, and the team is disbanded and members reassigned when the project is complete.


## Projects are Unique

Projects involve doing something which has not been done before by the business concerned - it is therefore, unique to that business. 

The upgrade of all client PC’s to Windows 2010 will not be unique to the IT industry as a whole, but it will be the first and only time the individual business will carry out the work

A competitor analysis may be carried out several times, but usually they involve a new product or service. 

## Example - Unique

Many thousands of office buildings have been developed, but each individual facility is unique

- different owner
- different design
- different location
- different contractors, and so on. 

## Why are Projects Important?

- Shortened product life cycles
- Narrow product launch windows
- Increasingly complex and technical products
- Emergence of global markets - competition
- Economic period marked by low inflation
- Increased business competition
- Effective use of financial resources is critical (reduce waste)

## A Successful Project

- Budget
- Client Acceptance
- Schedule
- Performance

## The Businesses Measure of Project Success

- The Users (clients) are happy with the new product or system!!
- The resulting product is acceptable to the customer.
- The product was delivered “on time.”
- The product was delivered “within budget.”
- Within specification
- The system development process had a minimal impact on on-going business operations. 
- The health, safety and environmental outcomes were met

## Success

- CSSQ & HSE
- Cost
- Schedule – (time)
- Scope – (specification)
- Quality 
- Health & Safety
- Environment

## Five components that may change over the course of the project

- Client interest, requirements
- Clients
- Project stake
- Resources
- Creativity
- Uncertainty (risk)

## Why Project Fail

Learning Outcomes

- Understand the key reasons why a project might fail

### Lack of Executive Support

Executive Support influences the process & progress - lack of such can put a project at a severe disadvantage”

Project Sponsors must:

- Be the Visionary 
- As part of the senior management team they will be committed to the company’s strategies
- Champion the project – to meet their drivers (KPI’s, financial or reward targets)
- Take Responsibility and be Responsive. They need to be Business, Process and Results focused 
- Have certain technology skills or project related skills

### Lack of Clear Business Objectives

- The project must have a business purpose
- The ‘business’ will realise the revenue increase, the increased productivity
- The business will see the projects costs
- What did I get for my $1million?
- This is related to User Involvement where the project does not meet their objectives it is not adopted

### Lack of Experienced Project Management

- It’s the PM - They are focused to drive the project to success!!
- They are prepared to use, & experienced in, ‘best practice’ methodologies
- They must have Full Project Accountability: Financial, team, process & results management 
- They come with previous experience in ‘like’ projects
- They are experienced in estimating, time and task management skills
- Its about Project Management
- Is a process, is formalised with experience project managers

### Lack of Standard Tools & Infrastructure

- High risk projects use non-standard development environments
- Research and Development projects are the highest risk projects
- To make a standard project higher risk, add the ‘unknown’ or ‘unproven’
- Just because it is cheap and new, does not make it easy and simple

### Lack of Skilled Resources

- If skilled resources are not found in the business it is often cheaper to contract in as and when required
- Perception – a recent move to reduce project costs - easier to train in-house than pay for expensive external resources
- Experienced PM can timeslot expensive resources

### Lack of Formal Methodologies and Processes

- Analysis phase is still seen as an expensive option
- Project life cycle
- Project Portfolio Management 

### Lack of Good Estimating Skills

- How can I tell you how long and how much if I haven’t done it before!
- Time and resource estimating & management
- Budget and project cost management
- Reliable estimates – must reflect the true effort
- Historical information
- Using experienced resources and PM
- Using external companies who have completed ‘like’ projects

## The Project Life Cycle

### Project Life Cycle phases

- PHASE 1: Project Initiation
- PHASE 2: Project Planning
- PHASE 3: Project Execution and Controlling
- PHASE 4: Project Handover and Review

### Stage 1: Project Initiation

Define “The business problem or opportunity”

- Step 1. Preliminary investigation around the problem or requirement
- Step 2. Establish terms of reference
- Project Objectives, what it is going to do and what it will deliver
- Very approximate costs & benefits
- Is it worth doing?
- Step 3. Write/Present a Project Brief
- Step 4. Write a Project Proposal

#### The Project Brief

This might be a 1 -3 page letter or note outlining the problem or opportunity.

It’s a ‘heads-up’. It’s possible management didn’t even know they had a problem! Or an opportunity existed

#### The Project Proposal

The Proposal is the next stage once you have approval to further investigate the problem or opportunity.

It does require more detail than the brief but not as much as the project plan.

It’s an approximation; 
To get costs any more accurate is an expensive exercise and it could be a waste of time!

Large projects, or long duration projects require considerable time and effort to accurately determine Costs, Times and Expectations
Often just the estimation process is a project on it’s own!


### Stage 2: Project Planning

OK – so we want to seriously consider the project. We know approximately how long and how much …. now tell us what will it really take and cost!

DETAILED PLANNING 

- Detailed itemisation of what it is going to do and deliver
- The process of defining all possible project costs/resources and timelines
- Understand the project risks and what are the expected business impacts
- Determine the financial or strategic justification
- This phase could even be a project on it’s own! 

#### Detailed Planning Includes:

- Defining of the project requirements (Scope)
- Joint Requirements Planning 
- Brainstorming, questionnaires, interviews

Stakeholder determination & impact

User and Business ‘Requirements Analysis’ or Detailed ‘Problem, Opportunity, Constraints’ analysis

Quantitative risk analysis, Budget and control plans

#### Project Plan

This document details the project and it’s expectations 

Often a contractual document - between the Project Team and  the client or Senior Management

All project stakeholders agree project scope and deliverables

Best Practice: No signed Project Plan, then No Project Start

### Stage 3: Execution and Control

The System/Product Development Life Cycle

- Design the product(s) or system
- Pilot/trial version build and acceptance
- Build, implement the product(s) or system
- Progress testing
- Full user, client testing
- User and or client training
- Product delivered and accepted
- Contract Payment
 
### Stage 4: Handover and review

The look back: 
What could have done differently, better

Stakeholder Assessments

Project Administration
