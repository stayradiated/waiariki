

Components that change
======================

- Client interest, requirements
- Clients
- Project Stake
- Resources
- Creativity
- Uncertainty (risk)

Why projects fail
=================

- Process of gathering user requirements was poorly managed
- Allowed the service to go live with a number of significant risks
- Not all testing had been completed
- Product was not ready - "had not yet been fully developed or tested"
- Lack of adequate support resulted in significant stress and required additional time and effort from schools and the Ministry to manage the payroll. It also contributed directly to additional errors and system defects, through missed, inaccurate or duplicate transaction processing, and poorly-controlled system changes.


- Lack of competent staff
- Lack of user involvement
- Lack of guidelines and deadlines from other PM / Sponsor
- Poor planning
- Confusion in decision making polocies
- Important cross-management
- Poor communication
- Cost management - went over budget by $24 million
- Lack of testing
- Delays not foreseen
- Mission, vision, scope not clear
- Lack of senior support
- Lack of technical skills
- Improper management
- Lack of funding
- No change management plan

Change management plan
======================

1. Denial
2. Resist
3. Explore
4. Accept


_Executive Support influences the process & progress - lack of such can put a project at a severe disadvantage._

Project Sponsors must:

- Be the __Visionary__


Lack of Clear Business Objectives
=================================

- The project must have a business purpose
- The `business` will realise the revenue increase, the increased productivity
- The business will see the projects cost

Lack of Experienced Project Management
======================================

It's the PM - They are focused to drive the project to success.
They are prepared to use & experienced in 'best practice' methodologies
They use _Full Project Accountability_

Lack of Standard Tools & Infrastructure
=======================================

Lack of Skilled Resources
=========================

If skilled resources are not found in the business it is often cheaper to
contract in as and when required.

Lack of Formal Methodologies and Processes
==========================================

- Analysis phase is still seen as an expensive option
- Project life cycle
- Project Portfolio Management

Project Portfolio Management
============================

Sharing of resources between projects.

Lack of Good Estimating Skills
==============================

How can I tell you how long and how much if I haven't done it before?

- Time and resource estimating & management
- Budget and project cost management
- Reliable estimates - must reflect the true effort
    - Historical information
    - Using experienced resources with PM
    - Using external companies who have completed similar projects


Project Life Cycle
==================

- _Start of Project_
- Project Initiation
- Project Planning
- Project Execution and Control
- Project Handover and review
- _End of Project_

Stage 1: Project Initiation
===========================

Defining _The business problem or opporuntity_

1. Preliminary investigation around the problem or requirements
2. Establish terms of reference
    - Project Objectives, what it is going to do and what it will deliver
    - Very approximate costs & benefits
    - Is it worth doing?
3. Write/present a __Project Brief__
4. Write a __Project Proposal__

### Project Brief

This might be a 1 -3 page letter or note outlining the problem or opportunity.

It's a 'heads-up'. It's possible management didn't even know they had a problem! Or an opportunity existed


### Project Proposal

- The Proposal is the next stage once you have approval to further investigate the problem or opportunity.
- It does require more detail than the brief but not as much as the project plan.
- It's an approximation; 
    - To get costs any more accurate is an expensive exercise and it could be a waste of time!
- Large projects, or long duration projects require considerable time and effort to accurately determine Costs, Times and Expectations
    - Often just the estimation process is a project on it's own!

## Stage 2: Project Planning

_OK â€“ so we want to seriously consider the project. We know approximately how long and how much ... now tell us what will it really take and cost!_

### Detailed Planning 

- Detailed itemisation of what it is going to do and deliver
- The process of defining all possible project costs/resources and timelines
- Understand the project risks and what are the expected business impacts
- Determine the financial or strategic justification
- This phase could even be a project on it's own! 

### Detailed Planning Includes

- Defining of the project requirements (Scope)
    - Joint Requirements Planning 
    - Brainstorming, questionnaires, interviews
- Stakeholder determination & impact
- User and Business 'Requirements Analysis' or Detailed 'Problem, Opportunity, Constraints' analysis
- Quantitative risk analysis, Budget and control plans

### Detailed Planning Stage Deliverable - Project Plan

- This document details the project and it's expectations 
- Often a contractual document - between the Project Team and  the client or Senior Management
- All project stakeholders agree project scope and deliverables
- Best Practice: No signed Project Plan, then No Project Start

## Stage 3: Execution and Control

_The System/Product Development Life Cycle_

- Design the product(s) or system
- Pilot/trial version build and acceptance
- Build, implement the product(s) or system
- Progress testing
- Full user, client testing
- User and or client training
- Product delivered and accepted
- Contract Payment
 
## Stage 4: Handover and Review

- The look back: 
    - What could have done differently, better
- Stakeholder Assessments
- Project Administration
- The Final Project Handover Report
