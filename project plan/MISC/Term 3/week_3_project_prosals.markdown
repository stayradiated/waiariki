# Project Proposals

This step in the process adds substance to the initial concept or idea that was generated in the brief.

However it is not a full blown project plan

It is a high level outline of what the project is about, what benefits it might deliver, what risks are involved, how long it might take and what it might cost

It is a motivation to a client, stakeholders or senior management to understand and hopefully support further investigation into and planning of the project

It is a request for approval... Please sign here

## The Project Proposal Document

Details the project to:

- Business Managers
- Project Stakeholders
- Clients

It is the result of some initial research or a higher level feasibility study.

## Managerial Decision Process

- Should the project be done at all? _Project feasibility_
- What options are available? _Scenario’s_
- Should it be done now or later? _Priority_
- Should it be done in conjunction with other things? _Strategic_
- Is this the right time to spend the funds? _Financial drivers_

## Project Proposal Document Defines

The Purpose/Background/Issue/Opportunity

Why are we doing the project

What was the issue/background

What drivers brought about the decision to propose the project

What has happened that this project will change or fix

## The Format of the Project Proposal

Should be kept simple and succinct

Reflects the project in terms of Objectives, Scope, Costs and Timelines 
i.e. Business Impacts

Clarification of project expectations
Clear, Precise, Punchy – This may be your only chance!!!!


## End game is acceptance and sign-off

Stage 1: Project Initiation

The Acceptance of the Project Proposal takes the project to the next phase

Phase 2 - Detailed Planning

## Preparing the Project Proposal

The responsible person or project manager must assess the following:

- What, When, How?
- About how long?
- About how much?
- What are the business drivers/strategy?
- What is it that the stakeholders really want?

Complete a SWOT and/or PEST analysis
	
### SWOT

_Internal factors_

- Strengths
- Weaknesses
- Opportunities
- Threats

### PEST

_External factors_

- Political
- Economic
- Social
- Technological

## Initial Project Feasibility

- Has it been done before?
    - If so, what is different
- Can we do it?
- Should we do it?
- Can we buy instead of make?
    - If so, who do we buy if from?
    - Are they the best option?
    - Estimates – “Ball-park figures”?
- PEST and SWOT analysis

## Project Risks

_PEST Analysis – Measure of the external market_

__Political factors__ include areas such as tax policy, employment laws, environmental regulations, trade restrictions and tariffs and political stability. 

__Economic factors__ are economic growth, interest rates, exchange rates and inflation rate. 

__Social factors__ often look at the cultural aspects and include health & pollution consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. 

__Technological factors__ include ecological and environmental aspects and can determine barriers to entry, minimum efficient production level and influence outsourcing decisions. Technological factors look at elements such as Research & Development activity, automation, technology incentives and the rate of technological change 

- PEST Analysis
- The Global Competitive Index– World Economic Forum
- World Bank data
- Industry Websites

## SWOT Analysis

__SWOT Analysis__: – measure of the business in its environment.

__Strengths__: attributes of the organisation that are helpful to achieving the objective. 

__Weaknesses__: attributes of the organisation that are harmful to achieving the objective. 

__Opportunities__: external conditions that are helpful to achieving the objective. 

__Threats__: external conditions that are harmful to achieving the objective. 


## 1. Executive Summary

A summary of your whole report on one page

- This is your opportunity to capture your audience, create interest in your project and get support for it
- Use A I D A
    - A = Attention – Grab their attention
    - I = Interest – Stimulate their interest to read further
    - D = Desire – Stimulate their support for what you are proposing
    - A = Action – Ask for what you want or what they need to do!

## 2. Background

_Short description of the background around._

- What lead to the problem and/or opportunity
- A description of the problem and/or opportunity
- State the effects  or impacts the problem has on overall business operating profit or effectiveness
    - This is your chance to be innovative!

## 3. Objective

- This is business related focus – not technical
- What am I getting for my money?
- How is the project going to deliver to the Mission & Strategies
- Will define the business ‘achievable’ deliverables
- Examples:
    - The Customer Database to be accessible from the Intranet
    - The upgrade to include the latest 2010 tax requirements

## 4. Project Alternatives

- What alternatives exist to seize the opportunity or solve the problem?
- Can it be contracted out?
- Can it be resolved by changing something else?
- Can we lease or do we have to buy or build?
- Will it be resolved at a later date by another project or upgrade?
- Are there different ways of solving the same issue?
- Can it be combined with another project?

## 5. Feasibility

This is whether the approach to the various options will be successful or not and what the risks or benefits might be.

_There are different types of feasibility:_

- Technical
- Operational
- Schedule (time)
- Economic
- Social
- Legal

It is useful to compare different approaches in a  matrix or table to highlight the differences.

Use a ranking scale of sorts – to compare

### Ranking scales


Ranking scale with descriptions

Very High  =  8 - 10
High           = 6 - 7
Medium    = 5
Low            = 3 - 4
Very Low  = 1- 2

A = Highly suitable
B = Suitable
C = moderately suitable
D = Unsuitable
E = Highly unsuitable

Ranking scale - anchored
 Strongly agree   A               B                  C               D             E      Strongly disagree

How painful is it on  a scale of 1 – 10 with 1 equal to no pain and 10 equal to unbearable pain?

## 6a. Scope

The technical focus of the Project Brief 
How / when / using what / equipment 

Scope defines:
 The environment – the project ‘boundaries’
Hardware/system development expectations
Operating system or Database
Legacy system impacts

The resources and technical skills
Examples: 
Implementing a student wireless network into Waiariki
MYOB to be implemented on new operating system
Implementation to be carried out in parallel
Evaluation and design of new chart of accounts

## 6b. Scope Excluded

Defines what is NOT included 
to ensure that it is NOT included in the expectations by users or the sponsor

Define the marginal exclusions to ensure they do not ‘creep’ into the project

Existing cabling will not be upgraded
Because of the expected Taupo Mill sale, this site will not being upgraded
Current Internet access situation to remain
Does not include training
Does not include on-going maintenance

## 6c. Deliverables

These are the project outputs
A capability to Perform a service
A unique and tangible product
A full functional machine or software program 

## 6d. Milestones

These are specific point in time during the project where something significant in the project has been completed.

## 6e. Expected timeframe

This is a high level estimate as to how long the project will take.
Can be broken down into major a and displayed on a Gantt chart.

## 7. Budget

These are estimates!!

Could be plus or minus 20%

To get more accurate budget figures would be costly and the project may not even get go-ahead

Broken into Milestones or Deliverable phases

The costs in the first year plus any on-going costs must be calculated for the life of the delievrable


## 7b. Cost benefit analysis

He we used the Net present value to evaluate where the project is a sound financial decision.

We can also compare different cost options for achieving the desired outcomes and see which is the best.

Use ROI, PBP, PI and NPV – we will discuss later


## 8. Health and safety considerations

- Consider the most obvious H&S issues that are likely to arise as a result of the project going ahead
- These can be both positive and negative
- Give a high level how negatives might be managed
- Highlight how positives are good for the business


## 9. Environment and sustainability

- Consider what impacts the project might have on the environment
- These can be negative or positive.
- Consider what could be done to improve performance in these areas
- Highlight what will be done on both counts
- Eg. Solar heating, improved energy efficient equipment

## 10. Risks - Qualitative

- The high level and most obvious risks that you can assess.
- The magnitude of the impact on the project
- The probability of the risk factor happening
- A basic qualitative assessment of how one might eliminate or minimise the risk
- Use a matrix to display where the risks lie

## 11. Organisation	

Management needs to know who will be  involved – the primary stakeholders

- The Project Sponsor
    - The strategically motivated client
    - The person with the commitment to complete the project

The Project Manager

Project team members 

Project Business Leaders
e.g. The Accountant or Stores Manager

Project Technical Leaders
e.g. The Development Manager or IT Manager


## Many Iterations

Expect the Project Proposal to go through more than one iteration!
Why not, especially if this is the first time management has become aware of any problem or opportunity

Get a senior colleague to proof read and offer advice

Management may change items 
They will review the project in light of business or strategic direction
They are likely to seriously consider
Project costs and timelines
They may wish to include other features or exclude others

## 12. Your recommendations

Tell the reader why you think this project should be supported by them.

## 13. Proposal acceptance and sign off

Have  a place where the manager, sponsor or client can sign off that they accept your proposal so you can proceed to the next stage

## Appendices

- Include a PEST or PESTLE analysis
- Include a SWOT analysis
- Bullet point form would suffice
