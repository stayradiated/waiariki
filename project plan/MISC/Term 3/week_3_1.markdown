They can be great opportunities for learning. 

Auditing is compliance-based. It is used to ensure that project managers are using project management processes as they should. 

Auditing can also be an opportunity for coaching. The auditor can  Coach and assist the project manager in understanding how the methodology is applicable to their project. 

## Project Library

The PMO must also attempt to collect metrics that show how the organisation is benefiting from the services of the PMO. 

If the value of project management can be proven over time, then the value of the PMO will also have been validated.
