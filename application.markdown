## 1. Why You Enrolled

I have been interested in computing since primary school when I was first introduced to computers and the whole concept of technology.

This developed during high school years into a very strong passion for the development and design of web sites. The level of ICT exposure at high school was fairly basic, but was useful for giving me a reasonable understanding of real world application of computers and introduced me to a circle of like-minded friends and mentors. 

I believe my continued interest in ICT and passion to create useful products and services is demonstrated by my winning of the gold prize in the 2012 Ubuntu App Showdown - (http://developer.ubuntu.com/2012/08/announcing-the-ubuntu-app-showdown-winners/), and by the grades I have achieved so far in the Bachelor of Computing (please refer to my academic transcript).

The Bachelor of Computing, Communications and Technology offers the most practical means of gaining a thorough grounding and formal qualification in ICT.




## 2. Financial Status

I cover the cost of my board by working in my parent's business, Total Carpet Services, on a part-time basis.

I make a small amount from the sale of web sites to local businesses and development of web applications (see reference from D. Wilson at Cisco).
However, this does not cover the tuition fees and other associated course expenses.

If I were granted this scholarship, this financial stress would be significantly reduced allowing me to focus my energies on maintaining the level of achievement I have so far attained in the Bachelors degree.




## 3. Future Aspirations

I have already experienced success and satisfaction in designing and marketing useful applications.
It is my intention to use my qualifications and experience to set up a successful career working with others designing and implementing creative solutions.

In order to maximise these opportunities I have at Waiariki, I intend to undertake a Masters degree following my Bachelor.
