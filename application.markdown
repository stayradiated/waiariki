## 1. Why You Enrolled

I have been interested in computing since primary school when I was exposed to computers and the whole concept of technology.

This developed during high school years into a very strong passion for the development and design of web sites

The level of ICT exposure at high school was fairly basic, but was useful for giving me a fair understanding of real world application of computers and introduced me to a circle of like-minded friends and mentors. 

I believe my continued interest in ICT and passion to create useful products and services is demonstrated by my winning of the gold prize in the 2012 Ubuntu App Showdown - (*http://developer.ubuntu.com/2012/08/announcing-the-ubuntu-app-showdown-winners/*), and by the grades I have achieved so far in the Bachelor of Computing (refer to the academic transcript).

The Bachelor of Computing, Communications, and Technology offers the most practical means of gaining a through grounding and formal qualification in ICT.



## 2. Financial Status

I currently live at home with my parents in Rotorua and cover my board by working in the family business, Total Carpet Services, on a part time basis.

I make a very small amount from the sale of web sites to local businesses.
but this does not cover the tuition fees and other associated course expenses.

If I were granted this scholarship, the financial stress would be greatly alleviated and would allow me to focus on maintaining the level of achievement I have attained so far.


## 3. Future Aspirations

I have already experienced success and satisfaction in designing and marketing useful applications. It is my intention to use my qualifications and experience to make a successful career working with others designing and implementing creative solutions.
